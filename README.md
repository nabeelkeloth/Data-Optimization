# Data-Optimization
The OJ Data is from Dominikâ€™s Grocery Store in Chicago. It has weekly data for multiple years. Using this data should advise management what they should do. Your advice could include marketing strategies. Some suggestions or ideas are to: 
1. Estimate Quantity Demanded as a function of price (and similar prices) using a Log Transformation. Also, include marketing strategies in your regression. 
2. Combine Gross Margin information to advise the firm on maximizing profits. To avoid sales cannibalization, simultaneously have multiple products.
3. The estimates of margins and demand are only estimates. Perform Monte Carlo analysis to simulate different processes.
